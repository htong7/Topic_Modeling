# Topic Modeling and Dimensionality Reduction

This project involves the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction.

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

LDA is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. In the context of text modeling, these 'unobserved groups' equate to topics.

A value of λ close to 1 ranks terms solely based on their probability within the topic, while a value of λ close to 0 ranks terms solely based on their distinctiveness or exclusivity within the topic.

**Disadvantages:**
- Assumes that the topics are independent of each other; hence, only the frequency of the common occurrence of words is used.

## Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that is often used in data visualization. It's particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data.

#### Key Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: UMAP reduces high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional plot.
- **Preserving Structure**: It captures the similarities between data points, preserving both local and global structure.
- **Versatility**: UMAP can be used in various fields, including gene expression analysis.

## How it Works

UMAP uses a user-defined parameter, the number of neighbors, to control how much it focuses on local versus global structure. The algorithm then constructs a high-dimensional graph from the data and optimizes a low-dimensional graph to be as structurally similar as possible.

## Code Usage

The code in this project is used to perform topic modeling using LDA and dimensionality reduction using UMAP. The code reads a text file, tokenizes the text into sentences and words, trains an LDA model, and visualizes the topics. It also uses UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of word embeddings and plots the result.
